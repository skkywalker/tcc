### path-finding

This folder contains every related research and development
on path-finding algorithms.

The ones I would like to try are:

- Breadth First Search
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- A star (A\*)

They follow a natural progression, being one an evolution
of the previous.

Good reference to get started:
